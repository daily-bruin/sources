# Sources

A small little website the Daily Bruin uses to keep track of all of our sources.
It's powered by an Express server with a MySQL backend and a GraphQL endpoint,
and uses React on the frontend.

Check out the [design specification](designs/spec.md) for more info!

## Development

Soures uses dotenv. If you're in Daily Bruin, you'll want to
[download our .env file](https://drive.google.com/a/media.ucla.edu/file/d/1la9NABZ5NalqPjhJQsofZM3Y9p8iMGC5/view?usp=sharing).
If you're making your own, the values you'll want are:

```
DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_USER=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
G_CLIENT_ID=
G_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
